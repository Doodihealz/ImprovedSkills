# ImprovedSkills
For Azerothcore

Grants XP and bonus item procs for gathering, crafting bars, inks, and leather based on player level and profession skill.
Can be edited to change exp amounts per ore, disable exp, or disable procs all together.

You may freely edit and use this script, I just ask you to credit me is all.
